The map serves as a valuable tool for students, parents, and educators. It helps students and families identify schools that excel in particular subjects, aiding in decision-making for academic growth. Moreover, it highlights educational disparities, encouraging schools to reflect on where improvements are needed. The project not only enhances the accessibility of AP exam data but also emphasizes the importance of using performance metrics to guide educational reform and resource allocation.
